About the service
======================================

SURF ResearchCloud is a service to facilitate scientists' collaborative work. It is developed and offered by `_SURFsara`

As a scientist, you can use your **institutional credentials** to authenticate yourself, so you do not need to remember yet another password.

You can create so-called :doc:`Collaborative Organisations <collaborative_organisations>` where you can invite your fellow researchers to work as a team.
Each team member can further bring their own :doc:`data <datasets>`, :doc:`budgets <wallets_budgets>` and :doc:`applications <applications>` to share with the rest of the team.

:doc:`Workspaces <workspaces>` are the environments which you run to actually compute in. 
You can **share** them with your team in a *Collaboratie Organisation*, but you can also keep your **private** ones.

Within your workspaces, you can run applications and data that are readily available in our **catalogue**, or you can bring your own. 

You can decide upon creating your workspaces which underlying :doc:`cloud infrastructure <cloud_providers>` you want to use. 

You can keep your budgets under control by looking at their evolution as workspaces draw from them.
