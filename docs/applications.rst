Applications
======================================

Different communities can contribute applications to Resarch Cloud for others to use. The applications run in :doc:`Workspaces <workspaces>`.

Each application can provide different services and require different capacity and capabilities. When you create a workspace using each application, these requirements may limit the :doc:`cloud providers <cloud_providers>` you can choose to run your workspace on. 

You will need to dig into each application's characteristics to know how you can use it, log in to it, etc.
