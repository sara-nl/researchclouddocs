Collaborative Organisations
======================================


What is a collaborative organisation (CO)
-------------------------

Research Cloud is a platform for supporting research by working together with selected tools and data in workspaces. Working together is done with Collaborative Organisations. These are ad-hoc groups of people you can make or join to work together on a given research. The concept of the CO comes from `Science Collaboration Zone (SCZ) <https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SCZ/Science+Collaboration+Zone+Home>`. People are invited into COs based on inforamtion given by there identity provider (IdP). Different types of IdPs supported by SCZ are institute IdPs through SURFconext, or internationaly through EDUgain, or for example social IdPs like google and outlook.
