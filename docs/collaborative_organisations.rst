Collaborative Organisations
======================================

Collaborative Organisations are ad-hoc groups of people you can make or join to work together on a given research.

They are handled by `Science Collaboration Zone <https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SCZ/Science+Collaboration+Zone+Home>`. 

Instructions on how to manage these will follow soon.
