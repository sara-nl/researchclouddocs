Collaborative Organisations
======================================


What is a collaborative organisation (CO)
-------------------------

Research Cloud is a platform for supporting research by working together with selected tools and data in workspaces. Working together is done with Collaborative Organisations. These are ad-hoc groups of people you can make or join to work together on a given research. The concept of the CO comes from `Science Collaboration Zone (SCZ):  https://wiki.surfnet.nl/display/SCZ/Science+Collaboration+Zone+Home. People are invited into COs based on information given by there identity provider (IdP). Different types of IdPs supported by SCZ are institute IdPs through SURFconext, or internationaly through EDUgain, or for example social IdPs like google and outlook.


How are COs used in Research Cloud
-------------------------

In the research Cloud portal you can view the COs you are a member of under the `my profile` menu. All the members of the CO are listed. When you start a workspace the first thing you do is choose whether you run it for a specific CO, or it is a private workspace. Private workspaces are explained in another part of the documentation.

How to request a new CO
-------------------------

A new CO can be requested by using the `request` button on the new CO part of of the profile page. After the request is send to SURF our helpdesk will create a new CO in SCZ. You will a message after the CO is created. We will also start the procedure to create persistent CO storage for this CO in ResearchDrive. Details xabout this storage are explained in the next paragraph.

After the CO is created you can invite users into your CO from the SCZ user interface.
