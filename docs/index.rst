SURF Research Cloud
===============================

SURF ResearchCloud is a service to facilitate scientists' collaborative work.

As a scientist, you can use your institutional credentials to authenticate yourself, so you do not need to remember yet another password.
You can create so-called Collaborative Organisations where you can invite your fellow researchers to work as a team.
Each team member can further bring their own data, budgets and applications to share with the rest of the team.

Workspaces are the environments which you run to actually compute in. 
You can share them with your team in a Collaboratie Organisation, but you can also keep your private ones.

Within your workspaces, you can run applications and data that are readily available in our catalogue, or you can bring your own.

You can decide upon creating your workspaces which underlying (cloud) infrastructure you want to use. 

You can keep your budgets under control by looking at their evolution as workspaces draw from them.
