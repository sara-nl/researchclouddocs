Wallets and budgets
======================================

Research Cloud allows you to create :doc:`workspaces <workspaces>` which will draw from **budgets** that you may hold in underlying :doc:`cloud providers <cloud_providers>`. These budgets are made available to Research Cloud in so-called **wallets**. 

When creating a workspace, you can use wallets which you own as well as wallets that someone else owns and which they have made available to any of the :doc:`Collaborative Organisations <collaborative_organisations>` that you are a member of.

Using wallets
--------------

.. sidebar:: Requesting budgets

    To request **budgets** and **wallets**, or make changes to your already existing wallets, you can get in contact with the SURFsara helpdesk: `helpdesk@surfsara.nl`_

Wallets are the means through which you finance your workspaces in Research Cloud. Wallets are how we call in Research Cloud existing budgets that you have made available to yourself or to your Collaborative Organisations.

Budgets entitle you to use cloud providers, and they are issued to you by those cloud providers themselves. For example, you may hold a budget to allow you to use the `HPC Cloud https://doc.hpccloud.surfsara.nl>`, which you may have obtained as an `e-infra request <https://e-infra.surfsara.nl>`. 

Put differently, you must bring budgets into Research Cloud so that you can launch workspaces on cloud providers you have access to. Budgets are, therefore, something which exists outside of Research Cloud. Wallets are how we call budgets that have been made available in Research Cloud.

Once you have a wallet registered on your name in Research Cloud, you will be able to use it when creating a workspace. You will see a list of  wallets available to you in a step of the workspace-creation wizard. In that same step you will be able to see how different choices of cloud provider and size can affect the remaining credit in your wallet.


Accounting against wallets
----------------------------

Once you have launched a workspace, that wallet will start being debited for the usage that the workspace makes. 

At this stage, we support wallets for budgets on the HPC Cloud. The HPC Cloud reports daily usage for virtual machines which make your workspace, and in turn we debit this usage daily to your wallet. 


Managing budgets and wallets
--------------------------------

.. note:: We have plans to build self-service reporting and overall functionality to manage wallets, but for the time being the helpdesk is the way to go.


Our helpdesk team is in charge of handling your requests related to budgets and wallets. THey can verify your details against those from the requested budget or wallet, and they can make a wallet for you out of a given budget.

Our helpdesk may also help with explaining wallet usage.
