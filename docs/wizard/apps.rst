Workspace Wizard: Applications
=============================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you must choose which :doc:`application or applications <../applications>` you want to run in that workspace. These are provided by different communities.

You can see a list of applications available to you in the wizard. Your list is made of applications which are:

* offered to everybody, or 
* to any of the :doc:`Collaborative Organisations <../collaborative_organisations>` that you are a member of 

You can rely on each application's name and description to understand what it provides and requires. 

You can choose multiple applications for each workspace.
