Workspace Wizard: Collaborative Organisation
=============================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you must choose whether you want to make the workspace for yourself, or otherwise make it available to a given :doc:`Collaborative Organisation <../collaborative_organisations>` that you belong to.

You can see a list of Collaborative Organisations which you are a member of.

You can rely on each Collaborative Organisation's name and description to understand what it is.
