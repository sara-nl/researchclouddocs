Workspace Wizard: Datasets
=============================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you can choose which :doc:`dataset or datasets <../datasets>` you want to make available to the :doc:`application(s) <../applications>` in that workspace. These are provided by different communities.

You can see a list of datasets available to you in the wizard. Your list is made of datasets which are:

* offered to everybody, or 
* to any of the :doc:`Collaborative Organisations <../collaborative_organisations>` that you are a member of 

You can rely on each dataset's name and description to understand what it provides and requires. 

You can choose multiple datasets for each workspace. You can also opt for attaching **no** datasets to your workspace.
