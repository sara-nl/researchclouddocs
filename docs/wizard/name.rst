Workspace Wizard: Name and acceptance
==================================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you must make a few last decitions. Those are:

* You must give the workspace a **name**
* You must accept the terms and conditions

Then, you will be able to finally click the *Submit* button to see your workspace created. While it is being created you can see its status evolve along with what Research Cloud is doing to provision everything that your workspace needs.
