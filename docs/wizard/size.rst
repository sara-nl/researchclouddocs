Workspace Wizard: Size
=============================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you must make a choice on how big it should be.

You can take into consideration what you plan on running within your workspace, how big your input and output data is, how many users at the same time will be working within the workspace, etc. With this information in mind, along with the information you can read on each of the size option, you should be able to make a good decision as to which option to choose.
