Workspace Wizard: Budget, expiration and provider
==================================================

In the wizard to generate a workspace, you must make a few budget-related choices. Those are:

* You must give the workspace an **expiration date**
* You must choose a **wallet**
* You must choose a **cloud solution**

Wallets
--------

You must choose which :doc:`wallet <../wallets_budgets>` the workspace will draw from. The list of wallets you see is that of:

* wallets you own yourself, plus 
* those which are provided to :doc:`Collaborative Organisations <../collaborative_organisations>` that you are a member of 

You can rely on each wallet's name and description to understand what it provides. 

Cloud solution
---------------

Depending on your choices throughout the wizard (e.g.: size, application requirements, wallet), you will have a list of **cloud solutions** you can choose from. You can rely on the information displayed per solution to help you make your choice. 

Each of the cloud solutions you see shows the following:

* the provider's name
* an indication of the provider's location (i.e.: Netherlands, Europe, rest of the world)
* the size options that the provider can handle
* a cost estimation
* an indication of what the cost estimation means against the chosen wallet
* a description of the computing capacity that the provider offers
